# Bits
Fundamentals of Computer Programming with C#-Cap3
We are given the number n, the value v (v = 0 or 1) and the position p.
write a sequence of operations that changes the value of n, so the bit on
the position p has the value of v. Example: n=35, p=5, v=0 -> n=3.
Another example: n=35, p=2, v=1 -> n=39.
